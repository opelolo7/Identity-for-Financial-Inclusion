# Decentralized Identity for Financial Inclusion

## Overview

This project implements a blockchain-based decentralized identity system designed to promote financial inclusion for unbanked populations. By creating verifiable digital identities with attached reputation mechanisms, we enable access to financial services while preserving user privacy and data sovereignty.

## Core Components

### Identity Creation Contract
Establishes secure, self-sovereign digital identities for individuals without requiring traditional banking infrastructure or documentation. Users can create their digital identity with minimal requirements while maintaining compliance with necessary regulations.

### Reputation Building Contract
Enables users to build verifiable financial histories through recording transactions, timely repayments, and other financial behaviors. This creates a portable credit history that follows the user across services.

### Service Access Contract
Connects identity holders with appropriate financial services based on their reputation and needs. Acts as a marketplace and gateway to services such as microloans, savings, insurance, and payment systems.

### Privacy Management Contract
Gives users granular control over what personal and financial information is shared with service providers. Implements zero-knowledge proofs for verification without full data disclosure.

## Getting Started

This repository contains the smart contracts, documentation, and sample implementations necessary to deploy a decentralized identity system for financial inclusion.

### Prerequisites
- Ethereum wallet/provider (MetaMask recommended)
- Node.js and npm
- Basic understanding of blockchain technology
- Truffle or Hardhat for development and testing

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decentralized-identity-finance.git
cd decentralized-identity-finance
npm install
```

### Configuration
Copy the example environment file and update with your settings:
```
cp .env.example .env
```

## Development

Smart contracts are written in Solidity and are located in the `/contracts` directory. The system adheres to ERC-725 and ERC-734 identity standards where applicable.

### Testing
```
npm test
```

### Deployment
```
npm run deploy:testnet
```

## Usage Examples

The `/examples` directory contains sample applications demonstrating how to integrate with the system, including:
- Creating a new identity
- Building financial reputation
- Connecting to financial services
- Managing privacy settings

## Roadmap

- Integration with additional blockchains for interoperability
- Mobile application for easier access
- Integration with biometric verification systems
- Expanded financial service provider marketplace
